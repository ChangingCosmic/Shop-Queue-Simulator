Check for the number of command line arguments
	If not enough print the following:
		Error: Wrong number of arguments!
		Usage: ./run_simulation <seed> <total_min> <arrival_prob> <order_prob> <num_queues> <outputFile>

Save the command line arguments in variables
Create the empty queue 
Add the first customer at time = 0
	
Create a vector of Customers pointers to store the completed customer data
	vector<shared_ptr<Customer>> completed;

Run the simulation: For each time step
	Calculate a random value between 0 and 1
	If smaller than the command line argument <arrival_prob>
		Add a customer to the shortest queue
			Calculate the length of service
	Check to see if the front customer is done:
		- peekFrontCustomer()
		- Calculate a random value between 0 and 1
		- If smaller than the command line argument <order_prob>
			Remove the customer from the queue
			Add to the completed vector
			Modify the completedTime variable
		- Set the start time of the next customer

When the simulation is finished:
	Print the data in the completed vector to a file
	use setw(8) between each output item
	Print summary data to the terminal
